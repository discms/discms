## How it works

When `discms` loads, the [GitHub Discussions search API][search-api] is used to find the Discussion associated with the page based on a chosen mapping (URL, `pathname`, `<title>`, etc.). If a matching discussion cannot be found, the `discms-bot` will automatically create a discussion the first time someone leaves a comment or reaction.

To comment, visitors must authorize the [discms app][discms-app] to [post on their behalf][authorization] using the GitHub OAuth flow. Alternatively, visitors can comment on the GitHub Discussion directly. You can moderate the comments on GitHub.

<!-- configuration -->

If you're using discms, consider [starring üåü discms on GitHub][repo] and adding the [`discms`][discms-topic] topic [to your repository][topic-howto]! üéâ

## Advanced

You can add additional configurations (e.g. allowing specific origins) by following the [advanced usage guide][advanced-usage].

To use discms with React, Vue, or Svelte, check out the [discms component library][discms-component].

## Migrating

If you've previously used other systems that utilize GitHub Issues (e.g. [utterances][utterances], [gitalk][gitalk]), you can [convert the existing issues into discussions][convert]. After the conversion, just make sure that the mapping between the discussion titles and the pages are correct, then discms will automatically use the discussions.
